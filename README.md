If you are interested in receiving periodic e-mails pertinent to ICE, you may either [subscribe to join the ICE Announcements E-mail List](https://groups.google.com/a/hln.com/forum/#!forum/ice-announcements) or contact us at ice@hln.com and we can add your e-mail address to the list for you. We send e-mail to this list only when there is important information to share about new releases or relevant to the operation of ICE. This is a low-volume list and we do not share group members' e-mail addresses with anyone.

If you have any questions, comments or suggestions, please e-mail us at ice@hln.com. For information about commercial support options available through HLN Consulting, please see https://www.hln.com/services/open-source/ice/ice-services.
